    "The growing emphasis on mental well-being, significantly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent Demand for remote support, has coincided with the rapid expansion of digital Technologies in the emergence of numerous mental health applications. Recognizing the critical role of mental health and overall wellness, individuals are increasingly seeking accessible and convenient digital support systems. This surge has given rise to a diverse landscape of mental health applications designed to assist users in navigating the complexities of stress, anxiety, depression, and a spectrum of other emotional challenges.\n",

    " As a result, user reviews have become an invaluable source of authentic information, providing a direct window into the real-world experiences of individuals utilizing these digital tools. These first-hand accounts offer rich insights into the aspects of these apps that users find beneficial, the challenges they encounter, and the overall effectiveness of these platforms in supporting their mental well-being. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, especially sentiment analysis, are crucial for deciphering the emotional nuances in these user-generated texts.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6)\n",

    "Our project plans to analyze how emotionally supportive AI mental health chatbots are, based on user satisfaction ratings. We are considering using publicly available user reviews from mental health apps providing AI chatbot functions. These reviews are usually shared on platforms like the Google Play Store or App Store, where users post their experiences voluntarily. Since we will not collect personal data ourselves and will only use public information, we expect the privacy risk to be low.\n",

To reduce this bias, we plan to include a large number of reviews from multiple apps and mention these limitations clearly in our analysis. We will also avoid making strong claims about the overall effectiveness of chatbots, and we will encourage responsible use of our findings.\n"
