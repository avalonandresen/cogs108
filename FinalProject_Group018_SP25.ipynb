    "\n",
    "Our report investigates the correlation between the frequency of emotionally supportive sentiment in user reviews and the average Google Play Store ratings for AI mental health chatbot applications. The study was motivated by the increasing demand for digital mental health support and the recognition that user reviews provide valuable insights into app effectiveness and user satisfaction. Prior research has highlighted the importance of sentiment analysis in understanding user feedback and its potential link to app ratings in various domains, including health and food delivery services. This research specifically defines emotionally supportive sentiment as expressions in reviews indicating users felt heard, understood, or emotionally uplifted by the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this relationship, publicly available user review data from the Google Play Store for 20 distinct AI mental health chatbot applications was collected. The data collection focused on reviews from 2023 to the present to ensure relevance to current AI technology and societal views on mental health. Key variables extracted included review text, star ratings, likes, and review dates. The methodology involved web scraping using the Google Play Scraper API and subsequent data cleaning and processing with Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and vaderSentiment for sentiment analysis. Reviews shorter than three words and non-English reviews were excluded to enhance the quality of the sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hypothesized that a significant positive correlation exists between the frequency of emotionally supportive sentiment in user reviews and higher Google Play Store ratings. While the initial findings are based on a dataset of 17,479 reviews from 20 apps, this represents a comprehensive sample within the scope of this project, despite the limitation of not accounting for apps across multiple app store platforms. The insights gained from this analysis are intended to provide valuable guidance for developers aiming to enhance user satisfaction and improve app performance in the evolving mental health application sector; however, these findings are specific to the study's parameters, recognizing that their generalizability beyond this project's scope is not guaranteed or intended without further validation in broader contexts and diverse user populations."

    "The growing emphasis on mental well-being, significantly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent Demand for remote support, has coincided with the rapid expansion of digital Technologies in the emergence of numerous mental health applications. Recognizing the critical role of mental health and overall wellness, individuals are increasingly seeking accessible and convenient digital support systems. This surge has given rise to a diverse landscape of mental health applications designed to assist users in navigating the complexities of stress, anxiety, depression, and a spectrum of other emotional challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    " As a result, user reviews have become an invaluable source of authentic information, providing a direct window into the real-world experiences of individuals utilizing these digital tools. These first-hand accounts offer rich insights into the aspects of these apps that users find beneficial, the challenges they encounter, and the overall effectiveness of these platforms in supporting their mental well-being. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, especially sentiment analysis, are crucial for deciphering the emotional nuances in these user-generated texts.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6)\n",

    "The dataset primarily comprises app reviews, which inherently contain rich textual data reflecting user sentiment, experiences, and perceived emotional support. Each review typically includes:\n",
    "- Review Text: The qualitative feedback provided by the user.\n",
    "- Star Rating: A quantitative measure of user satisfaction (typically on a scale of 1 to 5).\n",
    "- Likes/Helpful Votes: Indicators of how other users perceive the utility or resonance of a review.\n",
    "- Date of Review: Temporal information for tracking trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries and Tools\n",
    "Our analysis is performed using Python, leveraging a suite of powerful libraries for data manipulation, web scraping, natural language processing, and visualization. The key libraries utilized in this project for data cleaning include:\n",
    "- pandas: Essential for efficient data loading, cleaning, and manipulation, including handling DataFrames, filtering rows, and creating new columns.\n",
    "- seaborn: Provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics, enhancing our data visualizations.\n",
    "- google_play_scraper: Used for web scraping publicly available user review data from the Google Play Store.\n",
    "- datetime: Utilized for handling and comparing date and time objects, particularly for filtering reviews by a specific cutoff date.\n",
    "- vaderSentiment: Specifically, SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from this library is used for performing Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) sentiment analysis on the review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal dataset might involve direct access to anonymized app usage data and user feedback provided through in-app surveys or consent-based data sharing, which would offer richer insights beyond just the text of the reviews. Since each app has a varying number of reviews, we intend to use all the reviews from the timeframe. We will only consider English reviews to keep the reviews consistent, and we are going to remove reviews less than 3 words to have more context for our sentiment analysis and to prevent bias towards positive or negative reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the primary limitation of our real-world data will be the limited amount of apps available (20 aps) which is a limitation we attempted to address to the best of our ability. Similarly, there is also a lack of direct access to user engagement and detailed demographic information, which could provide additional context but are not central to our current research focus on the relationship between review sentiment and app ratings."

    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "20apps_reviews_cleaned Dataset: This dataset combines user reviews (17,479) from 20 different mental health chatbot apps retrieved from the Google Play Store. We extracted and renamed 5 key variables from the dataset: 'id' (the unique identifier for each review, stored as an integer), 'review' (the user's feedback message, stored as a string), 'rating' (the user's numerical rating from a scale of 1-5, stored as an integer), 'likes' (the number of likes the review message received, stored as an integer), and 'date' (the date when the review was posted, stored as a string). The 'rating' variable represents user satisfaction/sentiment towards the specific app, while the 'likes' variable is a proxy for how useful a review is perceived to be. To clean the dataset, we included variables relevant to our data analysis while excluding information such as the username to adhere to privacy concerns. Furthermore, we sorted the data by user rating (highest to lowest) to improve clarity and enable accurate sentiment analysis. We performed data wrangling by extracting reviews from the apps, filtering all twenty apps by a cutoff date of January 1, 2023 to the present. Lastly, we renamed the relevant columns ('content', 'score', 'thumbsUpCount', 'at') to 'review', 'rating', 'likes', and 'date'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the correlation between emotionally supportive sentiment in reviews and Google Play Store ratings, we plan on combining the reviews of the 20 AI mental health chatbots through data wrangling. Since the datasets share the same columns ('id', 'review', 'rating', 'likes', 'date'), we will concatenate them vertically and add an 'app' column to identify the source of each review. Furthermore, we intend to implement reusable functions that take the twenty apps as input to avoid code redundancy and facilitate the efficiency of our analysis.\n",

    "Our project analyzed how emotionally supportive AI mental health chatbots are, based on user satisfaction ratings. We used publicly available user reviews from mental health apps providing AI chatbot functions. These reviews are shared on the Google Play Store, where users post their experiences voluntarily. While we used publicly available data, we acknowledge and adhered to the Google Play Store's terms of service regarding data collection. Since we did not collect personal data ourselves and only used public information, the privacy risk was low.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we understand that some reviews may include emotional or sensitive personal stories. Even though usernames are usually hidden or anonymized, we were careful not to highlight any specific or identifying content. If we found any comments that seemed too personal, we chose to summarize them or leave them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also acknowledge that not everyone leaves app reviews. People who write reviews may have very strong opinions—either positive or negative—so the data may not represent all users fairly. Furthermore, our reliance on English-language reviews exclusively from the Google Play Store means our findings do not generalize to non-English speaking populations or users of other app platforms. Similarly, individuals without regular smartphone access, limited digital literacy, or those who prefer traditional mental health care may be underrepresented, leading to a dataset composed of a specific user demographic. We mention these limitations clearly in our analysis. We also assessed the performance of our sentiment analysis tool (VADER) in capturing nuanced mental health language, as general sentiment models may exhibit biases or misinterpret context-specific emotional expressions. We avoided making strong claims about the overall effectiveness of chatbots, and we encouraged responsible use of our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to protecting individual privacy and accounting for sampling and algorithmic bias, we also considered the potential unintended consequences that could arise from how this project is interpreted or shared. We recognize that discussions around mental health apps can have real-world impacts. If our findings are shared more broadly, we want to avoid misinterpretation. To prevent this, we did not rank apps or make claims about clinical effectiveness. Instead, we focused on general patterns of emotionally supportive sentiment and clearly stated the limitations of our data."
