17,"When I first came across this app, it was sold to me as Duolingo for Emotions. Initially I thought it took more concentration but overtime it has become part of my routine and I've learnt amazing skills and perspectives to why I behave/think/feel the way I do. Highly recommend this! It is worth the cost if you are willing to put the effort it.",5,5,2025-04-23
18,"this app explains why I have anxiety, I have not really found the part yet that helps with it. I hope I do soon though.",4,0,2025-04-23
19,"So very buggy. The lessons are the ONLY function working as intended. The lessons are helpful. Everything else has a bug of some sort. I paid for all the functions for a year. Reached out to support and was told they're ""on it"". not sure what that means, but I'm definitely cancelling until they follow up or I see improvement.",2,0,2025-04-22

30,"This company used an AI image of Brittney Spears after she had a breakdown and shaved her head with the caption, ""This could have been a 2-minute reflection, not a buzzcut."" If this app is willing to exploit the mental health of someone in an effort to advertise, they do not respect your emotions and health. This company is disgusting.",1,5,2025-04-15
31,wish there was different options sometime neither fits and just pick a random scenario,4,1,2025-04-15
32,"Developers who don't know how to save UI state on app going into background do not deserve to be paid, sorry. Nice visuals awfully coding all over.",1,1,2025-04-12
33,"really liking this so far. satisfyingly affirmational, - clearly a lot of thought was put into this app.",5,1,2025-04-11

35,"nevermind it shouldn't cost me money, I'll use AI instead.",1,0,2025-04-09

38,I like this app.,5,0,2025-04-07
39,"The free week trial has been helpful, a two week trial would have been more beneficial for seeing if using the app sticks before committing. The content itself is really well done and serves as great supplemental therapy.",5,12,2025-04-04

42,"I'm really not fond of there only being one option of a subscription, $59 for a year. I probably won't continue after my trial unless this thing works miracles.",2,3,2025-04-03
43,"I enjoy using this app, I have paid for a year subscription. I just finished the positivity section, but I wish there was an option to reset my progress on it or something so I can redo it and have it remember which ones I've redone (like a gold tick instead of purple for the ones done again). The customer service isn't good, I emailed asking how to access the check in page as I have achievements for check in which remains empty as I can't find it, but no one gets back to me.But content is good",4,5,2025-04-01
44,"Have you take a self assessment test. Which any professional will tell you is not a valid method of analysis, while assuring you that they have a fair 5 day trial. Apparently by fair they mean we are going to ask for your credit card in advance and you are signing a contract to pay $80 for our service if you don't cancel 24 hours before the day six. And we won't let you even see what our service offers without this contract to pay. This is called a scam.",1,2,2025-04-01
45,"So far it's easy to use and fun, Ive been doing my work with my therapist but it's hard for me to find the words to express myself and understand what I'm feeling, this app is helping me to work on each aspect step by step. I like it a lot",5,3,2025-03-31
46,"Canceled autopay for the free trial ending and didn't want to spend $64, got it taken out of my bank anyway, and then learned from the app that they ""don't do refunds"" and told my bank it was a legit charge. I only make a low amount a month and they put my bank into the negative and won't return the money. Won't be using again.",1,9,2025-03-27
47,Uninstalled before using because they basically want a yearly subscription. there is no free access unless you subscribe.,1,5,2025-03-26
48,"This app is predatory. I tried to cancel my 7-day trial on the seventh day, but realized I had already been charged for a year subscription ($80!). I feel like a fool. The activities I did for a week were not helpful and extremely basic. Zero stars from me. :(",1,22,2025-03-25

52,"False advertising‚Äì there's no free plan, you have to pay to access any of the features. sad, because I really thought it might be helpful, but I refuse to pay another subscription; I would have considered a one time payment, but subs are ridiculous. Uninstalled immediately once they asked for payment details.",1,194,2025-03-17
53,"I'm pleasantly surprised at the efficacy of this app. Using it for the breakup emotional regulation and it's been really helpful. The interactive pieces are varied so it keeps attention. The brain science is helpful and informative. The exercises are helpful! I love the widget option. I wish there was more ability to edit journal entries and titles but I'm really happy with it overall. As someone who does not journal, the questions and prompts are introspective and useful. Recommended fully!",5,24,2025-03-17
54,You have to pay to use it even though the app claims it's free. It's only free for 30 days and you HAVE to put in your card information to even get into the app at all. You have no choicen on just using this app for free despite its claims of being a free app. You can take a free test and that is literally it. Can't even put your email in before they ask for your card info. This app is a scam.,1,8,2025-03-17
55,"Thanks for wasting 15min of my life and giving some hope before telling me about the money. Definitely not trusting you to help with my emotions if the first thing you do is manipulate me. Tell me about the subscription first, not after.",1,9,2025-03-16

60,One should be able to try out the app without providing any payment details!!,1,12,2025-03-14
61,Been using it for 3 days now and I'm honestly very impressed! Great ways to learn and extra resources linked with scientific articles.,5,1,2025-03-11
62,"All the information and how it's provided is very helpful. Why is the primary text color a light gray against a white background üò≠ It's annoying to try and read, and fails WCAG!",1,15,2025-03-08
63,Great,5,0,2025-03-06

65,Not free.,1,6,2025-03-04
66,very helpful,5,0,2025-02-28
67,Unclear what to do. Cloying graphics and text. Mostly just attempts to sell paid service.,3,5,2025-02-28
68,"Seems like a cool app, very similar to Duolingo .but they are not upfront about the pricing. They don't tell you that it cost money until you've completed a few of their questionnaires, from then you have the option to start a free trial for 7 days, or pay $100 for yearly subscription. You can also try a 30-day trial for $6.90. (cad) really interesting idea and I'm sure it can be helpful but I resent apps that are not upfront about the price so I'm not going to try it for now.",2,72,2025-02-26
69,"website was broken - menu page/tray didn't pop out when tapped and i couldn't find information about a free plan or pricing anywhere before i getting started - downloaded the app to give this feedback to the developer. Will be uninstalling now and may actually check it out later, but i can't afford to be pulled into something i can't see the cost of, even if i think the concept is cool",1,26,2025-02-26
70,"NOT free. Subcrptions are such a scam. Rather pay just one time and be done at a FAIR PRICE, not the 150$ point they have. This app made my stress and anxiety WORSE, if anything.",1,29,2025-02-26

90,"Only used it once. The app says it'll remind you before the trial ends so you can cancel before it charges you, but I never received a reminder and got charged $60 anyway. Not happy about it.",1,24,2025-02-03
91,Not for me tbh,3,2,2025-01-23

96,Said it was free. Yeah right ü§£ sure 7 day free trial. Then nothing on this app is free,1,18,2024-12-10
97,Claims be free but absolutely not filled out the whole thing and while getting to the very end when it says it's completely free my hair lit on fire from a candle towards the very end of filling out distracted believing my life may actually go somewhere and I may actually get some help for free .. literally it is not free must subscribe for any use at all what a disappointment wow all of that ..,1,82,2024-12-09
