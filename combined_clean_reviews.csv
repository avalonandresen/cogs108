13,This has taught me thought replacement and has successfully stopped my from spiraling into panic attacks. I can keep a job now! cheaper than therapy and very helpful. would recommend for older people who understand how to talk to an AI to get the response they need. Be specific and precise with responses; Use keywords and keep it short. It does offer the same advice and techniques used in therapy but for much cheaper and without judgement from a live human (: 5 stars all the way! (: ‚ô°,5,29,2023-04-26,Wysa

241,This is an amazing app for increasing your emotional intelligence. My one request would be for the amount of exercise done to not only be one value per day. Often exercise happens later in the day but then will retroactively be applied to earlier entries from that day. This doesn't make sense for correlating amount of exercise and mood. What might make more sense is something like amount of exercise in the last 24 hours for each entry or something like that.,5,1,2023-11-05,How We Feel

51,"I decided to try this app on a whim; I had no idea it would be so useful! Talking to the AI interface is very similar to talking to an actual human therapist - it asks you questions, challenges your beliefs, and gives you advice that a therapist would give. It's just glitchy enough to remind you that you're not talking to a human, but still speaks in validating, encouraging terms. And because it's AI, you don't have to worry about being judged. I love this app and recommend it.",5,41,2024-09-30,Ash: AI Therapy

151,"I've been using this app for a while now, and it was really helpful at first. However, I recently noticed some changes that have made it less useful for me. Specifically, the app seems to be repeating my own words back to me without providing any real guidance or insight, which defeats the purpose of using it in between therapy sessions.

157,Not enough boundaries and it can feel too real. It's organized but many times it feel like it was replacing a therapist in an unhealthy way. Perhaps if it was more organized more about patterns than conversations. Talking doesn't do it only analyzing your patterns and reflecting do. Otherwise the rest of the features offer nothing but feeling like it's trying tk replace therapist job.,3,1,2025-04-26,Ash: AI Therapy
