5,"It's simple and has a good range of emotions to pick from. The emotions are all within 4 categories (high energy pleasant, low energy pleasant, high energy unpleasant and low energy unpleasant). If you click on each feeling, it has a short description so you can easily identify them in case you don't know what the word means for sure. It keeps track of your check ins and you can keep a streak by recording your emotions daily. Also it's free! I highly recommend this app for mood tracking. ü§é",5,9,2024-07-23

11,"Great app. I never write reviews but this app propelled me to do it. The design is super clean. I have a suggestion though, can you please make a widget? It will be much easier if there will be a widget of this app so that everytime I go to my home screen, I will be immediately reminded to check in. Also, it's much difficult to differentiate between certain feelings like calm, at ease, good. It will be very helpful if you can add extra Information of each paragraph. Thank you",5,28,2024-07-20
12,"Absolutely the best,most engaging mood tracking app. The graphics are gorgeous and make me actually remember and want to track my emotions. I just found the ability to put multiple emotions in one check-in, and it has made this app 10 times better for me.

26,"I have been trying to find a good mood tracking app for years. Every app I tried either didn't let me see what was actually affecting my general moods, had a bunch of needless fluff, or required a subscription. I had given up until I saw How We Feel. This is the holy grail of mood tracker apps. No ads, no subscriptions, a simple breakdown of moods, easily adjustable activity tags. This is it.

33,"I'm somebody who is quite knowledgeable in the field of psychology and trauma surrounding emotional regulation with my challenges and a lot of other apps seemed very basic to me. But this app gets much more deeply into the mind-body connection, which I deeply value as someone with C-PTSD.

Amazing job guys, keep it up!",5,0,2024-08-10
34,"Referred from Buddhist Boot Camp's monthly emails. Love it so far. There's a glitch with the breathing exercises where I can't do any of them. Otherwise the app works great, looks great, & shows different correlations to your moods that you can check out on the analyze tab. I love that. It's been really helpful for me since I started tracking my moods throughout the day.

I'm now more able to identify what negative emotions I'm feeling, but because of that I'm also getting big bursts of positive emotions. I'm actually very surprised with how it works.

47,"What an awesome tool for this 71 year old who only had two feelings, ok and stink (not ok). I particularly enjoyed all the initial reflections from your team. My intro to the tool came from our neuroscientist daughter - I telling her that I agreed with my Dr to track for a month any effects when I dropped a certain medication. Typically, a spreadsheet... but soon I realised it may have done the job for the month, but not given me so much more learning around feelings. Still using it 3mths. Thks",5,0,2024-08-03

No all-knowing and sitting atop the stoic tower, dispensing pity towards the emotionally illiterate children who need to be treated with kid gloves.

What might make more sense is something like amount of exercise in the last 24 hours for each entry or something like that.,5,1,2023-11-05

254,"Fantastic ad-free experience that doesn't feel judgey and maintains a modern UI. In a recent update, the interface for check-ins became more complicated and required more steps to finish checking in. Love the extra depth available to folks, but part of why I like the app is that it's super quick to check in and doesn't require a lot of work to do. There's a ""quick save"" option now, but imo users should be able to set how long that button hold takes, 1-3 seconds. It feels too long right now",5,6,2023-10-22

This was also one of the only free apps I could find that let you share with others. A mood chart was recommended by my doc and this works great for us. The only two things that would make this 5 star is if 1. You could set friend sharing to automatic. I hate having to do it manually everyone and 2. Being able to set custom emotions.

883,Really enjoy using the app after it was recommended by a therapist. I love how it categorises emotions and feelings into different categories. It's helped me to understand core emotions too. The definition of each feeling/emotion is a nice touch. Only critique would be to have an icon for pain and an icon that we can edit our own definition into. Definitely recommend for people who are in therapy or trying to understand patterns and triggers in their mood and mental health triggers.,4,0,2023-09-16
