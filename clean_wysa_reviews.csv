You can go 2 ways when starting out, either work on your own (which IMO is for those who have a strong sense of self and are in a mind frame with some faith and hope still present) or, you can go with a coach (which IMO if for those who are a bit more lost, and aren't feeling like they have much faith and/or hope left. Either way, there are many exercises you can go through in many different categories. 7 day free trial available.",5,1,2023-03-17
