    "The growing emphasis on mental well-being, significantly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent Demand for remote support, has coincided with the rapid expansion of digital Technologies in the emergence of numerous mental health applications. Recognizing the critical role of mental health and overall wellness, individuals are increasingly seeking accessible and convenient digital support systems. This surge has given rise to a diverse landscape of mental health applications designed to assist users in navigating the complexities of stress, anxiety, depression, and a spectrum of other emotional challenges.\n",

    "We hypothesize that there will be a significant positive correlation between the frequency of emotionally supportive sentiment expressed in user reviews and the average Google Play Store rating for the selected AI mental health chatbot apps.

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to investigate the correlation between emotionally supportive sentiment in user reviews and Google Play Store ratings for AI mental health chatbot apps, we will collect publicly available user review data from the Google Play Store for the three selected apps: Wysa, How We Feel, and Ahead: Emotions Coach. Based on the reviews, we will analyze variables which include the review message itself, star rating, date of the review, a boolean value (potentially by custom keyword lists, manual labeling, or a combination) determining if the review expressed emotionally supportive sentiment or not (matching for phrases indicating empathy, validation, and care), and which app the review was for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the apps were developed/released at different times and have changed throughout the years, we want to narrow the time frame to reviews from 2023-2025. This timeframe aims to capture more recent data, disregarding reviews from outdated versions of the app or when the AI technology was not as advanced, ensuring a better consistency across apps regarding AI evolution, which reflects current societal views on mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to use web scraping tools like the [Google Play Scraper API](https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/) to organize the reviews from each app into usable datasets. We aren't sure which specific Python libraries we will use to conduct the sentiment classification but potentially TextBlob or VADER. We may also use Pearson's r to find the correlation between the frequency of supportive sentiments and average star ratings per app. The ideal dataset might involve direct access to anonymized app usage data and user feedback provided through in-app surveys or consent-based data sharing, which would offer richer insights beyond just the text of the reviews. Since each app has a varying number of reviews, we intend to use all the reviews from the timeframe in How We Feel and Ahead: Emotions Coach because they are relatively low. Furthermore, we will use 1500-2000 reviews in the timeframe from Wysa, so we avoid being biased towards Wysa. We will only consider English reviews to keep the reviews consistent, and we are going to randomly sample a portion of reviews from each app to prevent bias towards positive or negative reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal dataset would use a relational database where each review is stored as a row, and the identified variables (review text, rating, date, sentiment score, app name) are organized as columns. This structure will enable efficient querying, filtering, and analysis to directly address our research question on the correlation between supportive sentiment and ratings. The database will link each review to its corresponding app and the date it was posted to enable app-specific and time-based analyses relevant to our research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the primary limitation of our real-world data will be the lack of direct access to user engagement and detailed demographic information, which could provide additional context but are not central to our current research focus on the relationship between review sentiment and app ratings."

    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "20apps_reviews_cleaned Dataset: This dataset combines user reviews (17,479) from 20 different mental health chatbot apps retrieved from the Google Play Store. We extracted and renamed 5 key variables from the dataset: 'id' (the unique identifier for each review, stored as an integer), 'review' (the user's feedback message, stored as a string), 'rating' (the user's numerical rating from a scale of 1-5, stored as an integer), 'likes' (the number of likes the review message received, stored as an integer), and 'date' (the date when the review was posted, stored as a string). The 'rating' variable represents user satisfaction/sentiment towards the specific app, while the 'likes' variable is a proxy for how useful a review is perceived to be. To clean the dataset, we included variables relevant to our data analysis while excluding information such as the username to adhere to privacy concerns. Furthermore, we sorted the data by user rating (highest to lowest) to improve clarity and enable accurate sentiment analysis. We performed data wrangling by extracting reviews from the apps, filtering all twenty apps by a cutoff date of January 1, 2023. Lastly, we renamed the relevant columns ('content', 'score', 'thumbsUpCount', 'at') to 'review', 'rating', 'likes', and 'date'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the correlation between emotionally supportive sentiment in reviews and Google Play Store ratings, we plan on combining the reviews of the 20 AI mental health chatbots through data wrangling. Since the datasets share the same columns ('id', 'review', 'rating', 'likes', 'date'), we will concatenate them vertically and add an 'app' column to identify the source of each review. Furthermore, we intend to implement reusable functions that take the twenty apps as input to avoid code redundancy and facilitate the efficiency of our analysis.\n",

      "Review: i'm loving this app. it's pretty (dopamine), it's easy to learn how to use, and i like that you can set up reminders to check in multiple times a day, either at set times or random ones, and that you can also check in at any time if you're feeling something you want to document. it's only been a week but i also like that you can edit the tags and see various analyses of your data. support is also incredibly prompt. i was amazed by the speed of response when i couldn't figure something out.\n",

      "Review: i started headspace back in 2014 (now 2024), it was the app that was the key to unlocking my meditation journey. after building up my practice over the years, using the app and other training, i got to a point where i felt comfortable in guiding myself. over the past couple of years my practice has weakened, but recently i have scome back to it. like the foundations of a building, it's reinforcing the strength back into my practice. thank you andy and the team 🙏\n",

      "Review: i absolutely love using headspace! i found the guided deep breathing techniques were my favorite aspect of the app. i noticed they were able to calm down my nervous system, which is the complete opposite of the short, fast breathing experienced during a panic attack for example. i felt my fear and stress response were lowered a lot, which are common symptoms of anxiety disorders. since breathing fast increases adrenaline and stress, i found slowing down had the opposite (calming) effect.\n",

    "Our project plans to analyze how emotionally supportive AI mental health chatbots are, based on user satisfaction ratings. We are considering using publicly available user reviews from mental health apps providing AI chatbot functions. These reviews are usually shared on platforms like the Google Play Store or App Store, where users post their experiences voluntarily. Since we will not collect personal data ourselves and will only use public information, we expect the privacy risk to be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we understand that some reviews may include emotional or sensitive personal stories. Even though usernames are usually hidden or anonymized, we will be careful not to highlight any specific or identifying content. If we find any comments that seem too personal, we may choose to summarize them or leave them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also acknowledge that not everyone leaves app reviews. People who write reviews may have very strong opinions—either positive or negative—so the data may not represent all users fairly. To reduce this bias, we plan to include a large number of reviews from multiple apps and mention these limitations clearly in our analysis. We will also avoid making strong claims about the overall effectiveness of chatbots, and we will encourage responsible use of our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to protecting individual privacy and accounting for sampling bias, we are also considering the potential unintended consequences that could arise from how this project is interpreted or shared. We recognize that discussions around mental health apps can have real-world impacts. If our findings are shared more broadly, we want to avoid misinterpretation. To prevent this, we will not rank apps or make claims about clinical effectiveness. Instead, we will focus on general patterns of emotionally supportive sentiment and clearly state the limitations of our data."

    "Our team has developed a detailed weekly plan to guide our final project, which investigates the relationship between user sentiment in mental health chatbot app reviews and their corresponding star ratings on the Google Play Store. We are using a Google Play Store API/web scraper to collect review data and plan to apply sentiment analysis techniques to quantify emotional tone. All methods and tools fall within the scope of COGS 108 as far as we are aware, and we do not currently anticipate needing additional resources or training beyond course materials.\n",
