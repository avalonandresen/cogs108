    "The growing emphasis on mental well-being, significantly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent Demand for remote support, has coincided with the rapid expansion of digital Technologies in the emergence of numerous mental health applications. Recognizing the critical role of mental health and overall wellness, individuals are increasingly seeking accessible and convenient digital support systems. This surge has given rise to a diverse landscape of mental health applications designed to assist users in navigating the complexities of stress, anxiety, depression, and a spectrum of other emotional challenges.\n",

    "Our project plans to analyze how emotionally supportive AI mental health chatbots are, based on user satisfaction ratings. We are considering using publicly available user reviews from mental health apps providing AI chatbot functions. These reviews are usually shared on platforms like the Google Play Store or App Store, where users post their experiences voluntarily. Since we will not collect personal data ourselves and will only use public information, we expect the privacy risk to be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we understand that some reviews may include emotional or sensitive personal stories. Even though usernames are usually hidden or anonymized, we will be careful not to highlight any specific or identifying content. If we find any comments that seem too personal, we may choose to summarize them or leave them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also acknowledge that not everyone leaves app reviews. People who write reviews may have very strong opinions—either positive or negative—so the data may not represent all users fairly. To reduce this bias, we plan to include a large number of reviews from multiple apps and mention these limitations clearly in our analysis. We will also avoid making strong claims about the overall effectiveness of chatbots, and we will encourage responsible use of our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to protecting individual privacy and accounting for sampling bias, we are also considering the potential unintended consequences that could arise from how this project is interpreted or shared. We recognize that discussions around mental health apps can have real-world impacts. If our findings are shared more broadly, we want to avoid misinterpretation. To prevent this, we will not rank apps or make claims about clinical effectiveness. Instead, we will focus on general patterns of emotionally supportive sentiment and clearly state the limitations of our data."

All methods and tools fall within the scope of COGS 108 as far as we are aware, and we do not currently anticipate needing additional resources or training beyond course materials.\n",

    "Each team member has actively participated in regular communication, and we have agreed to maintain consistent daily check-ins through group messaging to ensure progress, clarify responsibilities, and evenly distribute tasks. While roles are not permanently assigned, responsibilities are flexibly shared and adjusted week-to-week to accommodate individual availability, ensuring balanced collaboration and workload across the team.\n",

    "| Meeting Date  | Meeting Time| Completed Before Meeting  | Discuss at Meeting |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 4/14  |  1 PM DIB 121| Each member reviewed the COGS 108 guidelines and explored potential research topics involving app ratings.  | Established group communication (Group Message & Zoom). We set team expectations and brainstormed 3–5 initial topic ideas. | \n",
    "| 4/21  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Each member brought one specific research question, one dataset source idea and any potential datasets they were able to find based on their research question.  | Narrowed to a focus on AI chatbots in mental health (originally healthcare) and user review sentiment vs. Google Play Store star ratings. Began discussing project scope and team expectations for the Project Review. | \n",
    "| 4/24  |  2:30 PM  ZOOM| Each member reviewed the COGS 108 guidelines and further explored potential prior research on mental health or topics involving app ratings.  | Finalized research question and discussed different skills among group members toward project strengths. Confirmed division of tasks with consistent asynchronous check-ins via messages and collaboration/communication in our Google Doc; Set timeline for Project Proposal at Week 5 discussion. | \n",
    "| 4/28  |  1 PM DIB 121| Conducted literature review on sentiment analysis of app reviews; researched Google Play store web scraping. Checked in for 90%+ completion of Project Proposal. | Finalized remaining Project Proposal sections and each member proofread all updated changes and collaborated to an agreement on our current proposal by end of discussion and remotely via messages. | \n",
    "| 4/30  |  1 PM ASYNC/ZOOM| Each member final reviews the Project Proposal on GitHub and proofreads for the final time.  | Ensure Proposal completed and uploaded to GitHub Repo before 11:59p.m. | \n",
    "| 5/5  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Make any corrections needed based on Project Proposal Feedback. Finalize datasets to use in Data Checkpoint to discuss and continue working with in Discussion. Begin scraping app reviews and star ratings using a [Google Play Store API/web scraper](https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/).  | Start cleaning data and review scraping progress; finalize data fields (text, star rating, metadata). Set progress check-in goals for during the week before 5/14 due date. | \n",
    "| 5/11  |  8 PM Zoom| Discussed the responsibilities of each group member and distribute the work for data checkpoint. Review the feedback we received for project proposal. | Start cleaning data and review scraping progress; finalize data fields (text, star rating, metadata). Meet up one more time before submission | \n",
    "| 5/12  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Explore existing online APIs for Google Play store reviews. Expand on web scraping and pulling the data into a singular dataset. Explore features for correlation analysis. Ensure each member transfers a section from the Project Proposal notebook to the Data Checkpoint notebook for Git practice.  | Find methods to correlate scores with Google Play Store ratings. Validate the results with a sample of reviews. Create any follow-up edits to the data checkpoint and meetings necessary before the 5/14 submission due date. | \n",
    "| 5/19  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Extract emotionally supportive sentiments from reviews. We will finalize a structured CSV containing the cleaned dataset: app name, review, sentiment score, and star rating, with any corrections from Checkpoint #1 Feedback. We run statistical tests (possibly Pearson correlation) between sentiment scores and ratings. We generate visualizations (box plots, histograms, scatter plots) based on which visualization we find most effective using Seaborn and Matplotlib. | We interpret statistical results and finalize which visualizations are best for communicating key findings. We begin outlining the Results and Discussion sections of the report and delegate the writing, editing and reviewing prior to next meeting. |\n",
    "| 5/26  |  1 PM  DIB 121| All written sections (Introduction, Setup, Data Cleaning, Results) are combined into a single draft. We ensure all submitted files meet guideline formatting, naming conventions, and contain proper citations. We make final EDA tweaks as needed. | We hold a team review of the full report. Each member provides peer feedback on clarity and visual layout. Ensure all information is in the correct notebook and updated to Github. We'll begin scripting and scheduling time to record the project video. |\n",
    "| 6/2  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Continue planning and editing the video script. Finalize scheduled time to record the project video. Set expectations for the Final Report editing and video compilation/editing.  | We finalize editing on the report and continue working on/editing video, upload files to Final Report Notebook on our repo, and review the rubric one last time to ensure all requirements are met. Set a meeting date during 6/5-6/9 to communicate progress/troubles/adjustments to timelines before Final due date next week. |\n",
    "| 6/9  |  ZOOM | Finalize the report, prepare the presentation, and improve visuals. We commit our finalized report to Github, video link, and begin group self-evaluation survey.  | We reflect on the project, ensure all members complete team surveys individually, and share final thoughts to completed prior to 6/13 deadline to ensure accurate representation of the rubric. Decide which group member will submit group video to Canvas. |"
