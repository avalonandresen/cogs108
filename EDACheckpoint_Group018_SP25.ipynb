    "The growing emphasis on mental well-being, significantly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent Demand for remote support, has coincided with the rapid expansion of digital Technologies in the emergence of numerous mental health applications. Recognizing the critical role of mental health and overall wellness, individuals are increasingly seeking accessible and convenient digital support systems. This surge has given rise to a diverse landscape of mental health applications designed to assist users in navigating the complexities of stress, anxiety, depression, and a spectrum of other emotional challenges.\n",

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to investigate the correlation between emotionally supportive sentiment in user reviews and Google Play Store ratings for AI mental health chatbot apps, we will collect publicly available user review data from the Google Play Store for a diverse set of 20 AI mental health chatbot applications. Based on the reviews, we will analyze variables which include the review message itself, star rating, date of the review, a boolean value (potentially by custom keyword lists, manual labeling, or a combination) determining if the review expressed emotionally supportive sentiment or not (matching for phrases indicating empathy, validation, and care), and which app the review was for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the apps were developed/released at different times and have changed throughout the years, we want to narrow the time frame to reviews from 2023 to the present. This timeframe aims to capture more recent data, disregarding reviews from outdated versions of the app or when the AI technology was not as advanced, ensuring a better consistency across apps regarding AI evolution, which reflects current societal views on mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "We used web scraping tools like the [Google Play Scraper API](https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/) to organize the reviews from each app into usable datasets. \n",
    "The dataset primarily comprises app reviews, which inherently contain rich textual data reflecting user sentiment, experiences, and perceived emotional support. Each review typically includes:\n",
    "- Review Text: The qualitative feedback provided by the user.\n",
    "- Star Rating: A quantitative measure of user satisfaction (typically on a scale of 1 to 5).\n",
    "- Likes/Helpful Votes: Indicators of how other users perceive the utility or resonance of a review.\n",
    "- Date of Review: Temporal information for tracking trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries and Tools\n",
    "Our analysis is performed using Python, leveraging a suite of powerful libraries for data manipulation, web scraping, natural language processing, and visualization. The key libraries utilized in this project for data cleaning include:\n",
    "- pandas: Essential for efficient data loading, cleaning, and manipulation, including handling DataFrames, filtering rows, and creating new columns.\n",
    "- seaborn: Provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics, enhancing our data visualizations.\n",
    "- google_play_scraper: Used for web scraping publicly available user review data from the Google Play Store.\n",
    "- datetime: Utilized for handling and comparing date and time objects, particularly for filtering reviews by a specific cutoff date.\n",

    "The ideal dataset might involve direct access to anonymized app usage data and user feedback provided through in-app surveys or consent-based data sharing, which would offer richer insights beyond just the text of the reviews. Since each app has a varying number of reviews, we intend to use all the reviews from the timeframe. We will only consider English reviews to keep the reviews consistent, and we are going to remove reviews less than 3 words to have more context for our sentiment analysis and to prevent bias towards positive or negative reviews. \n",

    "Overall, the primary limitation of our real-world data will be the limited amount of apps available (20 aps) which is a limitation we attempted to address to the best of our ability. Similarly, there is also a lack of direct access to user engagement and detailed demographic information, which could provide additional context but are not central to our current research focus on the relationship between review sentiment and app ratings."

    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "20apps_reviews_cleaned Dataset: This dataset combines user reviews (17,479) from 20 different mental health chatbot apps retrieved from the Google Play Store. We extracted and renamed 5 key variables from the dataset: 'id' (the unique identifier for each review, stored as an integer), 'review' (the user's feedback message, stored as a string), 'rating' (the user's numerical rating from a scale of 1-5, stored as an integer), 'likes' (the number of likes the review message received, stored as an integer), and 'date' (the date when the review was posted, stored as a string). The 'rating' variable represents user satisfaction/sentiment towards the specific app, while the 'likes' variable is a proxy for how useful a review is perceived to be. To clean the dataset, we included variables relevant to our data analysis while excluding information such as the username to adhere to privacy concerns. Furthermore, we sorted the data by user rating (highest to lowest) to improve clarity and enable accurate sentiment analysis. We performed data wrangling by extracting reviews from the apps, filtering all twenty apps by a cutoff date of January 1, 2023. Lastly, we renamed the relevant columns ('content', 'score', 'thumbsUpCount', 'at') to 'review', 'rating', 'likes', and 'date'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the correlation between emotionally supportive sentiment in reviews and Google Play Store ratings, we plan on combining the reviews of the 20 AI mental health chatbots through data wrangling. Since the datasets share the same columns ('id', 'review', 'rating', 'likes', 'date'), we will concatenate them vertically and add an 'app' column to identify the source of each review. Furthermore, we intend to implement reusable functions that take the twenty apps as input to avoid code redundancy and facilitate the efficiency of our analysis.\n",

    "Our project plans to analyze how emotionally supportive AI mental health chatbots are, based on user satisfaction ratings. We are considering using publicly available user reviews from mental health apps providing AI chatbot functions. These reviews are usually shared on platforms like the Google Play Store or App Store, where users post their experiences voluntarily. Since we will not collect personal data ourselves and will only use public information, we expect the privacy risk to be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we understand that some reviews may include emotional or sensitive personal stories. Even though usernames are usually hidden or anonymized, we will be careful not to highlight any specific or identifying content. If we find any comments that seem too personal, we may choose to summarize them or leave them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also acknowledge that not everyone leaves app reviews. People who write reviews may have very strong opinions—either positive or negative—so the data may not represent all users fairly. To reduce this bias, we plan to include a large number of reviews from multiple apps and mention these limitations clearly in our analysis. We will also avoid making strong claims about the overall effectiveness of chatbots, and we will encourage responsible use of our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to protecting individual privacy and accounting for sampling bias, we are also considering the potential unintended consequences that could arise from how this project is interpreted or shared. We recognize that discussions around mental health apps can have real-world impacts. If our findings are shared more broadly, we want to avoid misinterpretation. To prevent this, we will not rank apps or make claims about clinical effectiveness. Instead, we will focus on general patterns of emotionally supportive sentiment and clearly state the limitations of our data."
