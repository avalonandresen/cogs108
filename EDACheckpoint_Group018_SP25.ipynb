    "| 4/21  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Each member brought one specific research question, one dataset source idea and any potential datasets they were able to find based on their research question.  | Narrowed to a focus on AI chatbots in mental health (originally healthcare) and user review sentiment vs. Google Play Store star ratings. Began discussing project scope and team expectations for the Project Review. | \n",
    "| 4/24  |  2:30 PM  ZOOM| Each member reviewed the COGS 108 guidelines and further explored potential prior research on mental health or topics involving app ratings.  | Finalized research question and discussed different skills among group members toward project strengths. Confirmed division of tasks with consistent asynchronous check-ins via messages and collaboration/communication in our Google Doc; Set timeline for Project Proposal at Week 5 discussion. | \n",
    "| 4/28  |  1 PM DIB 121| Conducted literature review on sentiment analysis of app reviews; researched Google Play store web scraping. Checked in for 90%+ completion of Project Proposal. | Finalized remaining Project Proposal sections and each member proofread all updated changes and collaborated to an agreement on our current proposal by end of discussion and remotely via messages. | \n",

    "| 5/5  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Make any corrections needed based on Project Proposal Feedback. Finalize datasets to use in Data Checkpoint to discuss and continue working with in Discussion. Begin scraping app reviews and star ratings using a [Google Play Store API/web scraper](https://github.com/facundoolano/google-play-scraper).  | Start cleaning data and review scraping progress; finalize data fields (text, star rating, metadata).

Meet up one more time before submission | \n",

Explore features for correlation analysis. Ensure each member transfers a section from the Project Proposal notebook to the Data Checkpoint notebook for Git practice.  | Find methods to correlate scores with Google Play Store ratings. Validate the results with a sample of reviews. Create any follow-up edits to the data checkpoint and meetings necessary before the 5/14 submission due date. | \n",
    "| 5/19  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Extract emotionally supportive sentiments from reviews. We will finalize a structured CSV containing the cleaned dataset: app name, review, sentiment score, and star rating, with any corrections from Checkpoint #1 Feedback. We run statistical tests (possibly Pearson correlation) between sentiment scores and ratings. We generate visualizations (box plots, histograms, scatter plots) based on which visualization we find most effective using Seaborn and Matplotlib. | We interpret statistical results and finalize which visualizations are best for communicating key findings. We begin outlining the Results and Discussion sections of the report and delegate the writing, editing and reviewing prior to next meeting. |\n",
    "| 5/26  |  1 PM  DIB 121| All written sections (Introduction, Setup, Data Cleaning, Results) are combined into a single draft. We ensure all submitted files meet guideline formatting, naming conventions, and contain proper citations. We make final EDA tweaks as needed. | We hold a team review of the full report. Each member provides peer feedback on clarity and visual layout. Ensure all information is in the correct notebook and updated to Github. We'll begin scripting and scheduling time to record the project video. |\n",
    "| 6/2  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Continue planning and editing the video script. Finalize scheduled time to record the project video. Set expectations for the Final Report editing and video compilation/editing.  | We finalize editing on the report and continue working on/editing video, upload files to Final Report Notebook on our repo, and review the rubric one last time to ensure all requirements are met. Set a meeting date during 6/5-6/9 to communicate progress/troubles/adjustments to timelines before Final due date next week. |\n",
    "| 6/9  |  ZOOM | Finalize the report, prepare the presentation, and improve visuals. We commit our finalized report to Github, video link, and begin group self-evaluation survey.  | We reflect on the project, ensure all members complete team surveys individually, and share final thoughts to completed prior to 6/13 deadline to ensure accurate representation of the rubric. Decide which group member will submit group video to Canvas. |"
