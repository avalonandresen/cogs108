Abstract


Our report investigates the correlation between the frequency of emotionally supportive sentiment in user reviews and the average Google Play Store ratings for AI mental health chatbot applications. The study was motivated by the increasing demand for digital mental health support and the recognition that user reviews provide valuable insights into app effectiveness and user satisfaction. Prior research has highlighted the importance of sentiment analysis in understanding user feedback and its potential link to app ratings in various domains, including health and food delivery services. This research specifically defines emotionally supportive sentiment as expressions in reviews indicating users felt heard, understood, or emotionally uplifted by the app.

To explore this relationship, publicly available user review data from the Google Play Store for 20 distinct AI mental health chatbot applications was collected. The data collection focused on reviews from 2023 to the present to ensure relevance to current AI technology and societal views on mental health. Key variables extracted included review text, star ratings, likes, and review dates. The methodology involved web scraping using the Google Play Scraper API and subsequent data cleaning and processing with Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and vaderSentiment for sentiment analysis. Reviews shorter than three words and non-English reviews were excluded to enhance the quality of the sentiment analysis.

It is hypothesized that a significant positive correlation exists between the frequency of emotionally supportive sentiment in user reviews and higher Google Play Store ratings. While the initial findings are based on a dataset of 17,479 reviews from 20 apps, this represents a comprehensive sample within the scope of this project, despite the limitation of not accounting for apps across multiple app store platforms. The insights gained from this analysis are intended to provide valuable guidance for developers aiming to enhance user satisfaction and improve app performance in the evolving mental health application sector; however, these findings are specific to the study's parameters, recognizing that their generalizability beyond this project's scope is not guaranteed or intended without further validation in broader contexts and diverse user populations.
