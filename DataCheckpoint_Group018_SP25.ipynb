    "In order to investigate the correlation between emotionally supportive sentiment in user reviews and Google Play Store ratings for AI mental health chatbot apps, we will collect publicly available user review data from the Google Play Store for the three selected apps: Wysa, How We Feel, and Ahead: Emotions Coach. Based on the reviews, we will analyze variables which include the review message itself, star rating, date of the review, a boolean value (potentially by custom keyword lists, manual labeling, or a combination) determining if the review expressed emotionally supportive sentiment or not (matching for phrases indicating empathy, validation, and care), and which app the review was for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the apps were developed/released at different times and have changed throughout the years, we want to narrow the time frame to reviews from 2023-2025. This timeframe aims to capture more recent data, disregarding reviews from outdated versions of the app or when the AI technology was not as advanced, ensuring a better consistency across apps regarding AI evolution, which reflects current societal views on mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to use web scraping tools like the [Google Play Scraper API](https://github.com/facundoolano/google-play-scraper) to organize the reviews from each app into usable datasets. We aren't sure which specific Python libraries we will use to conduct the sentiment classification but potentially TextBlob or VADER. We may also use Pearson's r to find the correlation between the frequency of supportive sentiments and average star ratings per app. The ideal dataset might involve direct access to anonymized app usage data and user feedback provided through in-app surveys or consent-based data sharing, which would offer richer insights beyond just the text of the reviews. Since each app has a varying number of reviews, we intend to use all the reviews from the timeframe in How We Feel and Ahead: Emotions Coach because they are relatively low. Furthermore, we will use 1500-2000 reviews in the timeframe from Wysa, so we avoid being biased towards Wysa. We will only consider English reviews to keep the reviews consistent, and we are going to randomly sample a portion of reviews from each app to prevent bias towards positive or negative reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal dataset would use a relational database where each review is stored as a row, and the identified variables (review text, rating, date, sentiment score, app name) are organized as columns. This structure will enable efficient querying, filtering, and analysis to directly address our research question on the correlation between supportive sentiment and ratings. The database will link each review to its corresponding app and the date it was posted to enable app-specific and time-based analyses relevant to our research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the primary limitation of our real-world data will be the lack of direct access to user engagement and detailed demographic information, which could provide additional context but are not central to our current research focus on the relationship between review sentiment and app ratings."

    "Our project plans to analyze how emotionally supportive AI mental health chatbots are, based on user satisfaction ratings. We are considering using publicly available user reviews from mental health apps providing AI chatbot functions. These reviews are usually shared on platforms like the Google Play Store or App Store, where users post their experiences voluntarily. Since we will not collect personal data ourselves and will only use public information, we expect the privacy risk to be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we understand that some reviews may include emotional or sensitive personal stories. Even though usernames are usually hidden or anonymized, we will be careful not to highlight any specific or identifying content. If we find any comments that seem too personal, we may choose to summarize them or leave them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also acknowledge that not everyone leaves app reviews. People who write reviews may have very strong opinions—either positive or negative—so the data may not represent all users fairly. To reduce this bias, we plan to include a large number of reviews from multiple apps and mention these limitations clearly in our analysis. We will also avoid making strong claims about the overall effectiveness of chatbots, and we will encourage responsible use of our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to protecting individual privacy and accounting for sampling bias, we are also considering the potential unintended consequences that could arise from how this project is interpreted or shared. We recognize that discussions around mental health apps can have real-world impacts. If our findings are shared more broadly, we want to avoid misinterpretation. To prevent this, we will not rank apps or make claims about clinical effectiveness. Instead, we will focus on general patterns of emotionally supportive sentiment and clearly state the limitations of our data."

    "| 4/14  |  1 PM DIB 121| Each member reviewed the COGS 108 guidelines and explored potential research topics involving app ratings.  | Established group communication (Group Message & Zoom). We set team expectations and brainstormed 3–5 initial topic ideas. | \n",
    "| 4/21  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Each member brought one specific research question, one dataset source idea and any potential datasets they were able to find based on their research question.  | Narrowed to a focus on AI chatbots in mental health (originally healthcare) and user review sentiment vs. Google Play Store star ratings. Began discussing project scope and team expectations for the Project Review. | \n",
    "| 4/24  |  2:30 PM  ZOOM| Each member reviewed the COGS 108 guidelines and further explored potential prior research on mental health or topics involving app ratings.  | Finalized research question and discussed different skills among group members toward project strengths. Confirmed division of tasks with consistent asynchronous check-ins via messages and collaboration/communication in our Google Doc; Set timeline for Project Proposal at Week 5 discussion. | \n",
    "| 4/28  |  1 PM DIB 121| Conducted literature review on sentiment analysis of app reviews; researched Google Play store web scraping. Checked in for 90%+ completion of Project Proposal. | Finalized remaining Project Proposal sections and each member proofread all updated changes and collaborated to an agreement on our current proposal by end of discussion and remotely via messages. | \n",
    "| 4/30  |  1 PM ASYNC/ZOOM| Each member final reviews the Project Proposal on GitHub and proofreads for the final time.  | Ensure Proposal completed and uploaded to GitHub Repo before 11:59p.m. | \n",
    "| 5/5  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Make any corrections needed based on Project Proposal Feedback. Finalize datasets to use in Data Checkpoint to discuss and continue working with in Discussion. Begin scraping app reviews and star ratings using a [Google Play Store API/web scraper](https://github.com/facundoolano/google-play-scraper).  | Start cleaning data and review scraping progress; finalize data fields (text, star rating, metadata). Set progress check-in goals for during the week before 5/14 due date. | \n",
    "| 5/11  |  8 PM Zoom| Discussed the responsibilities of each group member and distribute the work for data checkpoint. Review the feedback we received for project proposal. | Start cleaning data and review scraping progress; finalize data fields (text, star rating, metadata). Meet up one more time before submission | \n",
    "| 5/12  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Explore existing online APIs for Google Play store reviews. Expand on web scraping and pulling the data into a singular dataset. Explore features for correlation analysis. Ensure each member transfers a section from the Project Proposal notebook to the Data Checkpoint notebook for Git practice.  | Find methods to correlate scores with Google Play Store ratings. Validate the results with a sample of reviews. Create any follow-up edits to the data checkpoint and meetings necessary before the 5/14 submission due date. | \n",
    "| 5/19  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Extract emotionally supportive sentiments from reviews. We will finalize a structured CSV containing the cleaned dataset: app name, review, sentiment score, and star rating, with any corrections from Checkpoint #1 Feedback. We run statistical tests (possibly Pearson correlation) between sentiment scores and ratings. We generate visualizations (box plots, histograms, scatter plots) based on which visualization we find most effective using Seaborn and Matplotlib. | We interpret statistical results and finalize which visualizations are best for communicating key findings. We begin outlining the Results and Discussion sections of the report and delegate the writing, editing and reviewing prior to next meeting. |\n",
    "| 5/26  |  1 PM  DIB 121| All written sections (Introduction, Setup, Data Cleaning, Results) are combined into a single draft. We ensure all submitted files meet guideline formatting, naming conventions, and contain proper citations. We make final EDA tweaks as needed. | We hold a team review of the full report. Each member provides peer feedback on clarity and visual layout. Ensure all information is in the correct notebook and updated to Github. We'll begin scripting and scheduling time to record the project video. |\n",
    "| 6/2  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Continue planning and editing the video script. Finalize scheduled time to record the project video. Set expectations for the Final Report editing and video compilation/editing.  | We finalize editing on the report and continue working on/editing video, upload files to Final Report Notebook on our repo, and review the rubric one last time to ensure all requirements are met. Set a meeting date during 6/5-6/9 to communicate progress/troubles/adjustments to timelines before Final due date next week. |\n",
    "| 6/9  |  ZOOM | Finalize the report, prepare the presentation, and improve visuals. We commit our finalized report to Github, video link, and begin group self-evaluation survey.  | We reflect on the project, ensure all members complete team surveys individually, and share final thoughts to completed prior to 6/13 deadline to ensure accurate representation of the rubric. Decide which group member will submit group video to Canvas. |"
