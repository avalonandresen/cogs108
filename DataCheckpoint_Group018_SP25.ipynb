    "In order to investigate the correlation between emotionally supportive sentiment in user reviews and Google Play Store ratings for AI mental health chatbot apps, we will collect publicly available user review data from the Google Play Store for the three selected apps: Wysa, How We Feel, and Ahead: Emotions Coach. Based on the reviews, we will analyze variables which include the review message itself, star rating, date of the review, a boolean value (potentially by custom keyword lists, manual labeling, or a combination) determining if the review expressed emotionally supportive sentiment or not (matching for phrases indicating empathy, validation, and care), and which app the review was for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the apps were developed/released at different times and have changed throughout the years, we want to narrow the time frame to reviews from 2023-2025. This timeframe aims to capture more recent data, disregarding reviews from outdated versions of the app or when the AI technology was not as advanced, ensuring a better consistency across apps regarding AI evolution, which reflects current societal views on mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to use web scraping tools like the [Google Play Scraper API](https://github.com/facundoolano/google-play-scraper) to organize the reviews from each app into usable datasets. We aren't sure which specific Python libraries we will use to conduct the sentiment classification but potentially TextBlob or VADER. We may also use Pearson's r to find the correlation between the frequency of supportive sentiments and average star ratings per app. The ideal dataset might involve direct access to anonymized app usage data and user feedback provided through in-app surveys or consent-based data sharing, which would offer richer insights beyond just the text of the reviews. Since each app has a varying number of reviews, we intend to use all the reviews from the timeframe in How We Feel and Ahead: Emotions Coach because they are relatively low. Furthermore, we will use 1500-2000 reviews in the timeframe from Wysa, so we avoid being biased towards Wysa. We will only consider English reviews to keep the reviews consistent, and we are going to randomly sample a portion of reviews from each app to prevent bias towards positive or negative reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal dataset would use a relational database where each review is stored as a row, and the identified variables (review text, rating, date, sentiment score, app name) are organized as columns. This structure will enable efficient querying, filtering, and analysis to directly address our research question on the correlation between supportive sentiment and ratings. The database will link each review to its corresponding app and the date it was posted to enable app-specific and time-based analyses relevant to our research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the primary limitation of our real-world data will be the lack of direct access to user engagement and detailed demographic information, which could provide additional context but are not central to our current research focus on the relationship between review sentiment and app ratings."
