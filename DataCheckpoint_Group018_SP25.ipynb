    "In order to investigate the correlation between emotionally supportive sentiment in user reviews and Google Play Store ratings for AI mental health chatbot apps, we will collect publicly available user review data from the Google Play Store for the three selected apps: Wysa, How We Feel, and Ahead: Emotions Coach. Based on the reviews, we will analyze variables which include the review message itself, star rating, date of the review, a boolean value (potentially by custom keyword lists, manual labeling, or a combination) determining if the review expressed emotionally supportive sentiment or not (matching for phrases indicating empathy, validation, and care), and which app the review was for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the apps were developed/released at different times and have changed throughout the years, we want to narrow the time frame to reviews from 2023-2025. This timeframe aims to capture more recent data, disregarding reviews from outdated versions of the app or when the AI technology was not as advanced, ensuring a better consistency across apps regarding AI evolution, which reflects current societal views on mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to use web scraping tools like the [Google Play Scraper API](https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/) to organize the reviews from each app into usable datasets. We aren't sure which specific Python libraries we will use to conduct the sentiment classification but potentially TextBlob or VADER. We may also use Pearson's r to find the correlation between the frequency of supportive sentiments and average star ratings per app. The ideal dataset might involve direct access to anonymized app usage data and user feedback provided through in-app surveys or consent-based data sharing, which would offer richer insights beyond just the text of the reviews. Since each app has a varying number of reviews, we intend to use all the reviews from the timeframe in How We Feel and Ahead: Emotions Coach because they are relatively low. Furthermore, we will use 1500-2000 reviews in the timeframe from Wysa, so we avoid being biased towards Wysa. We will only consider English reviews to keep the reviews consistent, and we are going to randomly sample a portion of reviews from each app to prevent bias towards positive or negative reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal dataset would use a relational database where each review is stored as a row, and the identified variables (review text, rating, date, sentiment score, app name) are organized as columns. This structure will enable efficient querying, filtering, and analysis to directly address our research question on the correlation between supportive sentiment and ratings. The database will link each review to its corresponding app and the date it was posted to enable app-specific and time-based analyses relevant to our research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the primary limitation of our real-world data will be the lack of direct access to user engagement and detailed demographic information, which could provide additional context but are not central to our current research focus on the relationship between review sentiment and app ratings."

    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset #1: This dataset, reduced from 143,000 user reviews to 5,800 user reviews after data cleaning, contains feedback for the Wysa mental health chatbot app retrieved from the Google Play Store. We extracted and renamed 5 key variables from the dataset: 'id' (the unique identifier for each review, stored as an integer), 'review' (the user's feedback message, stored as a string), 'rating' (the user's numerical rating from a scale of 1-5, stored as an integer), 'likes' (the number of likes the review message received, stored as an integer), and 'date' (the date when the review was posted, stored as a string). The 'rating' variable represents user satisfaction/sentiment towards Wysa, while the 'likes' variable is a proxy for how useful a review is perceived to be. To clean the dataset, we included variables relevant to our data analysis while excluding information such as the username to adhere to privacy concerns. Furthermore, we sorted the data by user rating (highest to lowest) to improve clarity and enable accurate sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset #2: This dataset contains user reviews for the How We Feel mental health chatbot app, which was also sourced from the Google Play Store. The original dataset includes 2,940 reviews, while the cleaned dataset consists of 1,146 review messages. Additionally, the original dataset includes the same variables as Dataset #1, and the same 5 primary variables were extracted to ensure consistency in data cleaning. We followed similar preprocessing steps where we handled missing values, converted the date to a datetime format, and ensured consistent data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset #3: This dataset consists of user reviews for the Ahead: Emotions Coach mental health app and follows the same structure as the first two datasets, with 343 reviews initially collected and 100 retained after preprocessing. Similar to Datasets #1 and #2, the 'rating' reflects user satisfaction, the number of likes indicates the review's popularity, and the review message is crucial for analyzing emotionally supportive sentiment. The dataset cleaning process was the same, where we performed data wrangling by extracting reviews from the app, filtering all three apps by a cutoff date of January 1, 2023. We cleaned the data by incorporating only the relevant columns ('content', 'score', 'thumbsUpCount', 'at'), renaming them to 'review', 'rating', 'likes', and 'date'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the correlation between emotionally supportive sentiment in reviews and Google Play Store ratings, we plan on combining these three datasets through data wrangling. Since the datasets share the same columns ('id', 'review', 'rating', 'likes', 'date'), we will concatenate them vertically and add an 'app' column to identify the source of each review. Furthermore, we intend to implement reusable functions that take the three apps as input to avoid code redundancy and facilitate the efficiency of our analysis."

    "Our project plans to analyze how emotionally supportive AI mental health chatbots are, based on user satisfaction ratings. We are considering using publicly available user reviews from mental health apps providing AI chatbot functions. These reviews are usually shared on platforms like the Google Play Store or App Store, where users post their experiences voluntarily. Since we will not collect personal data ourselves and will only use public information, we expect the privacy risk to be low.\n",

    "However, we understand that some reviews may include emotional or sensitive personal stories. Even though usernames are usually hidden or anonymized, we will be careful not to highlight any specific or identifying content. If we find any comments that seem too personal, we may choose to summarize them or leave them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also acknowledge that not everyone leaves app reviews. People who write reviews may have very strong opinions—either positive or negative—so the data may not represent all users fairly. To reduce this bias, we plan to include a large number of reviews from multiple apps and mention these limitations clearly in our analysis. We will also avoid making strong claims about the overall effectiveness of chatbots, and we will encourage responsible use of our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to protecting individual privacy and accounting for sampling bias, we are also considering the potential unintended consequences that could arise from how this project is interpreted or shared. We recognize that discussions around mental health apps can have real-world impacts. If our findings are shared more broadly, we want to avoid misinterpretation. To prevent this, we will not rank apps or make claims about clinical effectiveness. Instead, we will focus on general patterns of emotionally supportive sentiment and clearly state the limitations of our data."

Explore features for correlation analysis. Ensure each member transfers a section from the Project Proposal notebook to the Data Checkpoint notebook for Git practice.  | Find methods to correlate scores with Google Play Store ratings. Validate the results with a sample of reviews. Create any follow-up edits to the data checkpoint and meetings necessary before the 5/14 submission due date. | \n",
    "| 5/19  |  1 PM  DIB 121| Extract emotionally supportive sentiments from reviews. We will finalize a structured CSV containing the cleaned dataset: app name, review, sentiment score, and star rating, with any corrections from Checkpoint #1 Feedback. We run statistical tests (possibly Pearson correlation) between sentiment scores and ratings. We generate visualizations (box plots, histograms, scatter plots) based on which visualization we find most effective using Seaborn and Matplotlib. | We interpret statistical results and finalize which visualizations are best for communicating key findings. We begin outlining the Results and Discussion sections of the report and delegate the writing, editing and reviewing prior to next meeting. |\n",
